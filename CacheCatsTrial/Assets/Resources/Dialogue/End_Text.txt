It’s a quiet, easy-rocking evening aboard the Gem of Aphrodite. 
The sun sets, casting a beautiful golden hue across the sea and across your ship. 
The life of a pirate is full of trials and tribulations, ups and downs, joys and sorrows, but there’s one thing that holds true. 
It’s always better with your beloved by your side. Yo ho ho!
