# Pirate's Booty

Made in 48 (technically 49) hours as practice for McGameJam 2021.

The theme picked by a neutral party of our peers (okay, just Sarah) was "Water Aesthetic." 

## ***Game Description***

  *It’s a lovely, salt-scented morning aboard the Gem of Aphrodite, and you are a pirate captain. The sun is warm, the wind is brisk, and it’s everything a swashbuckling fiend such as yourself could want. There’s seas to sail and booty to be plundered! …… Well, perhaps everything isn’t quite as ship-shape as it may seem. The spoils are bountiful and the grog is stiff, but, truth be told, you’re a bit lonely. Pirateering is fun, but it would be even *more* fun if you had someone special to pirateer with. Thankfully, there seem to be plenty of fine mateys aboard. You start to walk around and get a lay of the land, so to say.*
